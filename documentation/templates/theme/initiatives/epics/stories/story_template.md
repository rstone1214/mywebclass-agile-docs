1.	 As a DevOps team, we want to automate the deployment process for our software applications, so that we can deploy changes quickly and reliably, while ensuring the quality and security of our application.

Acceptance Criteria:
The deployment process should be fully automated, from building the application to deploying it to production.
The automated deployment process should be triggered by a source control commit or merge.
The automated deployment process should be configurable to allow for different environments (e.g. staging, production) and different deployment strategies (e.g. blue-green, canary).
The deployment process should include automated testing and quality checks to ensure that the application is functioning correctly and meets the required quality standards.
The deployment process should be monitored and logged to allow for easy troubleshooting in case of issues or errors.
The deployment process should be easily repeatable, so that developers and operations personnel can deploy new changes with confidence.
The deployment process should be secure and adhere to all relevant security best practices.
The automated deployment process should be integrated with existing tools and processes, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines.

Description: As a DevOps team, we want to implement infrastructure as code, so that we can manage our infrastructure in a more efficient, reliable and scalable manner.

Acceptance Criteria:
The infrastructure code should be version-controlled and stored in a central repository.
The infrastructure code should be modular, so that it can be easily reused and maintained.
The infrastructure code should be tested to ensure that it deploys the required infrastructure in a consistent and reliable manner.
The infrastructure should be deployed using automation tools, such as Terraform or CloudFormation.
The infrastructure should be monitored and logged to allow for easy troubleshooting in case of issues or errors.
The infrastructure should be easily scalable, so that we can easily add or remove resources as required.
The infrastructure should be secure and adhere to all relevant security best practices.
The infrastructure code should be integrated with existing tools and processes, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines.
